# Ethical Hacking in Python :snake:

Repository that contains all the programs I built in Python :snake: while learning about Ethical Hacking :squirrel:

### Technologies
* Python
* Pycharm

### Programs built
* mac_changer - changes MAC Address to anything we want.
* network_scanner - scans network and discovers the IP and MAC address of all connected clients.
* arp_spoofer - runs an arp spoofing attack to redirect the flow of packets in the network allowing us to intercept data.
* packet_sniffer - filters intercepted data and shows usernames, passwords, visited links ....etc
* dns_spoofer - redirects DNS requests, eg: redirects requests to from one domain to another.
* file_interceptor - replaces intercepted files with any file we want.
* code_injector - injects code in intercepted HTML pages.
* arpspoof_detector - detects ARP spoofing attacks.
* execute_command payload - executes a system command on the computer it gets executed on.
* execute_and_report payload - executes a system command and reports result via email.
* download_and_execute payload - downloads a file and executes it on target system.
* download_execute_and_report payload - downloads a file, executes it, and reports result by email.
* reverse_backdoor - gives remote control over the system it gets executed on, allows us to
* Access file system.
* Execute system commands.
* Download & upload files
* keylogger - records key-strikes and sends them to us by email.
* crawler - discovers hidden paths on a target website.
* discover_subdomains - discovers subdomains on target website.
* spider - maps the whole target website and discovers all files, directories and links.
* guess_login - runs a wordlist attack to guess login information.
* vulnerability_scanner - scans a target website for weaknesses and produces a report with all findings.
